Font:
- Good choice on the font - is it this one? https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat It looks like "QWYX" is hand drawn? and "TECHNOLOGIES" / "CRAFTS" is somewhere around Medium 500 on the Montserrat font?

"Yes, I used Montserrat. Montserrat Medium 500 (0 letter spacing) for the second line of text and Bold 700 (150 letter spacing) for QWYX. Only "Q" is hand drawn since I find the original "Q" from Montserrat a little too curvy for the logo."
